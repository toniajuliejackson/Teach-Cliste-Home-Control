# Teach-Cliste-Home-Control
PROJECT TITLE _ Teach Cliste Home Control

PROJECT DESCRIPTION _ 
With the rapid advancement of network connected technology, home automation is a growing market.  

The objective of the project is to design and build a control interface that will bring together the control of light, heat, audio and video in a simple yet intuitive user interface. Despite there being applications available to control the majority of connected home devices, few combine this into a single interface.

The project will involve designing a front end interface which will run on an Apple iPad. The application will communicate with the different elements of the system using AMX. A working prototype will demonstrate a range of communication methods including infra-red, RS232 and IP.

Home automation technologies simplify living, but also helps monitor energy efficiency and security. The project will incorporate a popular lighting control system, the Phillips Hue, which will result in significant energy savings for the user. 

After conducting market research, it was noted that entertainment is a key element of home automation systems. With this in mind, the project will incorporate control of audio and video sources including Apple TV, Blu-ray player and much more. 

The control system will be developed on a NetLinx NX-3200 integrated controller and programmed in AMX NetLinx code. The user interface will be developed utilising TPDesign and hosted on an iPad by TPControl.
